# Description:
A simple calculator that takes a material and operating frequency as input and provides output related to the materials' conductive properties.

Currently only supports the below listed materials as defined within the application; however, I plan to eventually add functionality to allow users to add additional materials and custom values:
   Air, Fresh Water, Sea Water, Ice, Clay, Saturated Sand, Barium Titanate, Cold Rolled Steel, Purified Iron, Mu Metal, 2-81
   Permalloy, Copper, Gold, Aluminum, Tungsten, Graphite, Diamond, Silicon, Glass, Kiln Dried Wood & PTFE.

# Background:
This is a project inspired by a university EE assignment given to a colleague of mine, and I am using it (along with other projects) as valuable and dynamic learning tools for Python development.
In itâ€™s current state, it provides limited functionality on a decent set of materials; however, I plan to implement many changes and improvements as I move on (such as OOP).


# Please note:
I am but a novice coder, and my project(s) will definitely reflect as such.
Questions and comments are appreciated and welcomed- however, please try to be as helpful/informative as possible if you decide to make a suggestion/comment!
